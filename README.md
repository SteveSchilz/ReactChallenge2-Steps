# Udemy Ultimate React Course - Challenge #2 - State

This is a very simple react app implementing [Challenge #2](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/learn/lecture/37350602) from
the Udemy [Ultimate React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann

The point of the challenge is to utilize simple state functions correctly.

The app displays two SpinButton components that interact with
each other to calculate a date N days in the future.

It was interesting because the way that the challenge was laid out screams
for a component to encapsulate two buttons, a text value and a state value.

This was quite easy to do, but the fact that the "count" value depends on the
"step" value means that the state needs to be accessible outside of the
components.

This was handled by defining the state variables in the parent component,
and then passing the values and plain vanilla javascript callback to the components.
The callback updates the state variables in the parent.  
This all worked out quite elegantly.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
